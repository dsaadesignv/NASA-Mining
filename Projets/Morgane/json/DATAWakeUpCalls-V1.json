At this point STS-113 tied the previous record of two additional extensions waiting for good weather. With the additional day beyond that, they set a new record for the number of landing tries. The Jeopardy theme music was a running gag between Mike Lopez-Alegria and the Capcoms where he would pose various questions about the mission's status as quizzes. At one point the Capcom answered one of L-A's queries, and he replied “But you forgot to phrase it in the form of a question.” The evening before when MCC said goodnight a Capcom cautioned “the wakeup music may sound familiar.” Wetherbee replied “How will we know?” (a reference to the repeating cycle in the movie “Groundhog Day”.

The top two songs with the most votes from that list earned the right to be played as wake up music for Discovery’s crew during its final mission. As a bonus, actor William Shatner recorded a special introduction to the song: “Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before.” It was a fitting beginning to the day that will see Discovery undock from the space station for the last time. Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock to the International Space Station, during the STS-96 mission in 1999, marking just one time it did what no spacecraft had done before."

It was originally written as a tribute to the space program and workforce, and is routinely played in concert by the four-member band. The live performance was the first time a shuttle crew has been awakened “live” from Mission Control, Houston. “That was terrific,” Lindsey radioed down to Mohr. “We really appreciate it and congratulations on winning the contest.” Mohr, with his three band members in the control center, thanked Lindsey for his courage, bravery “and your effort in just giving all of us a better shot at knowing more. It’s very inspirational to the arts as well.”"

It was followed by a prerecorded message from Kennedy Space Center employees. “Three … two … one … Good morning, Atlantis!” the group said. “Kennedy salutes you. See you back at wheels stop!” Kennedy is home to the space shuttle fleet, along with its launch pads and the people who prepared the shuttles for each trip into space."

    "comment": "Kate Smith’s rendition of Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America” woke Commander Chris Ferguson, Pilot Doug Hurley and Mission Specialists Sandy Magnus and Rex Walheim. But unlike most wakeup songs, which are played in honor of a particular crew member, this one was dedicated to all the men and women who have worked for the Space Shuttle Program in the past three decades… “the men and women who put their heart and soul into the shuttle program for all these years,” as Capcom Shannon Lucid told the crew. Ferguson said it was an appropriate song for their last day in space."
